# Genetic-Algorithms
This repository is all about solving some well known backtracking problems with the help of genetic algorithm.

## Introduction to Genetic Algorithm
According to the article from [towardsdatascience](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-genetic-algorithms-including-example-code-e396e98d8bf3#:~:text=A%20genetic%20algorithm%20is%20a,offspring%20of%20the%20next%20generation.), a genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin's theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.
